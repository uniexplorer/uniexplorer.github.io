# Project

## Introduction
We created an interactive website which is not only interesting but also educational. Once visitors click into the website, they would receive a mission to build Parker, motivating them to read the introductions of Parker and know more about its historical records.  After they finished all the challenges, they would explore the journey of Parker through the animation, deepening their memories. This website introduces Parker in an easier way, allowing teenagers to understand this innovative spacecraft. Once more teenagers get to know the inspiring story of Parker through this website, they may develop an interest in space investigating and are likely to become outstanding researchers in the future.

## Structure
We depicted a story about Parker solar probe. Goals, Timeline, and Equipment are three main categories of our project. 

There is a challenge after each stories, we encourage users to finish the challenge and collect specific equipment for us. Once they finish learning, users then face an ultimate challenge with all knowledge metioned before. After all the materials are collected, a spacecraft, Parker solar probe is made.
